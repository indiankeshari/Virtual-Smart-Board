# Virtual-Smart-Board
<b>
  It is a project in which we can write with our finger in air. 
  We can change colors. Erase the written things. 
  It simply uses our camera and detect the fingers of hand. 
  If it find index finger then it write on the screen by following the movement of the finger. 
  If the distance between index finger and thumb is less than 30 mm then it stops writing. 
  If we want to change the color then we can do so by taking our index finger in the color box, and in the same way we can clear the screen.
