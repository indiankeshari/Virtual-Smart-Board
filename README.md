  It is a project in which you can write with your finger in air. 
  You can change colors. Erase the written things.
  It simply uses your camera and detect the fingers of hand.
  If it find index of right and then it write on the screen following the movement of the finger.
  If the distance between index finger and thumb is less than 3 cm then it stops writing.
  If you want to change the color then you can do so by taking your index finger in the color box, 
  and in the same way you can clear the screen.
